The first milestone intentionally keeps fleet records local-first while using Supabase for Google Sign-In and logout. Khata charges are linked back to work logs and vehicles so customer balances, QR amounts, receipts, and vehicle profitability can be derived from the same work entry.

**Why:** The user needs a usable operations tool immediately, including offline-friendly daily entry, while authentication is handled by the requested Supabase integration.

**How to apply:** Future persistence work should preserve the current entity relationships and replace local storage behind the store boundary rather than changing the user-facing flows.
